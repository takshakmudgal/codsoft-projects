# CodSoft Python Projects

Hi there! This is my collection of projects I did during my CodSoft Python Programming Internship built with Python, PyQt5, and various other libraries.

I'm Takshak, an aspiring software developer and engineer. Creating these projects has allowed me to grow my skills in Python GUI development, APIs, object-oriented programming, and more!

This global folder contains the following cool projects:

## Weather App

A beautifully designed weather app with custom UI elements. Allows users to fetch current weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Built with PyQt5 for the interface and requests library to call the API.

## To-Do List App

A todo list app with amazing aesthetics! Users can add, edit, and manage tasks with this tool.

Created using PyQt5 and follows modular, object-oriented code structure. Love the awesome UI on this one!

## Calculator App

A fully-functional calculator with calculator with a polished dark mode UI. Supports basic math, scientific functions, keyboard input, and more.

PyQt5 handles the frontend and math library provides the backend calculations.

## What I Learned

Through developing these projects, I gained valuable experience:

- Building responsive and aesthetic GUIs with PyQt5
- Fetching and using data from external APIs
- Structuring code following OOP principles
- Handling user input and events
- Using version control with Git/GitHub
- Debugging errors and edge cases
- Managing dependencies and packages
- Deploying finished applications
- Documenting projects with READMEs

These projects really helped me apply and solidify my Python and PyQt skills. I learned so much about planning, architecting, and completing real-world applications.

## Overview

Each project has its own dedicated README inside its folder with install instructions, usage, and more details.

The code is open source and available under the MIT license. Feel free to browse, run them locally, and even use them as starting points for your own projects!

I had a lot of fun building these and learned so much along the way. Let me know if you have any other project ideas I could try out!
